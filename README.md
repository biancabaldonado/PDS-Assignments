Python for Data Science Assignments

I. Assignment 1

This assignment file includes my code for the 18 exercises for basic Python. This encompasses the following topics: Syntax & Variables (Numbers 1-3), Lists & Dictionaries (Numbers 4-5), Tuples & Sets (Numbers 6-7), Control Flow (Numbers 8-11), Function (Numbers 12-14) and Integration of all functions (Number 15)
Note: Number 11's match function requires a newer version of Python, which is at least 3.10

II. Assignment 2

This assignment file includes my code for the 4 exercises for a deeper dive into Python. In particular, this encompasses the following topics: Creation of a Function (Number 1), Filtering of Data (Number 2), Creation and Appending of a List (Number 3), Creation of a Function for Temperature Convertion (Number 4)

III. Assignment 3

This assignment file includes my code for the 4 exercises that tackle Object Oriented Coding. This is done through the following topics: creation of a class that adds the names of students and the courses, creation of a class that acts as a registration for classes (enlisting and dropping) and finally, creation of a class that assigns the grades and the respective GPAs.

IV. Assignment 4

This assignment file includes my code for the 7 exercises for Basic Libraries, specifically os, glob and shutil. This is composed of the following topics: 1) Counting files of a folder, 2) Checking if the files follow the naming convention, 3) Extracting files per year, per month and per month-year, 4) Creating a new folder, 5) Sorting files, 6-7) Extracting information based on file naming convention
Disclaimer: All those part of incorrect convention will not be included in the succeeding numbers since they do not follow the naming convention pattern and as such, the numbers in the file are not intuitive and would need further information on how to interpret (only given the corresponding values for those following the naming convention and as such, I have only extracted the data from these)
Note: Number 3's match function requires a newer version of Python, which is at least 3.10
